/**
  This tool is here to correct the crazy ass key model
  of using hashed player names, which meant that any
  inaccuracy of a name led to some failures, and any
  change would require a key change.

  The primary places where keys show up are:
  * .shadows and .tokens are wrapped up with lib/auth
  data/.shadows - as CSV of key,shadow pairs
  data.tokens   - as CSV of key,token pairs

  data/sessions/<session_id> - as JSON { key, created_at }
  data/players/<key> - as JSON { key, name, email, created_at, verified }
  data/matches/<match_key> - JSON, nested games use keys in their player slots
  data/stats/<key> - as JSON { key, name, ...other_stuff }
